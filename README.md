The Perfect Match - Signup Form

Version: 1.0

About the project:

This project goes back to the basics of web development. It uses HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript to build a signup form which allows the user submit information about their username, email and password. This form, however, is not built to be mobile responsive.

Features of the project:

The user is able to enter their username, email and password inorder to signup. Although the form is not actually been submitted, clicking the submit button provides some form validation to double check the details entered are correct and in the right format. The username field cannot be left blank, the email must be in the correct format and the passwords must match. 

Technical Knowledge used:

This project was built with HTML, CSS with vanilla JavaScript used to provide client side form validation.
